            Kessler Topaz is committed to environmental sustainability and strives to do its part to help combat the ever-growing climate crisis.  As a Firm of over 175 people, many of which have young children, Kessler Topaz is acutely aware of the need to leave the planet in as good or better a position for all of our children and our childrens' children.  Further, as so many of its clients have adopted environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in their investment models, the Firm makes a point to stay abreast of developments in this area of investment and the ramifications across the global institutional investor community. 
        </div>

        <br>

        While the Firm does not have a formal written environmental sustainability policy, we do bring our environmental sustainability philosophy into every facet of our operations at both our Headquarters in Radnor, Pennsylvania and in our San Francisco, California office, and in our practice generally. For example, the Firm employs a Facilities Manager tasked with overseeing all operations at its Radnor Headquarters and San Francisco office.  The Firm recycles and breaks down all paper, glass and plastic items.  All coffee-ware (purchased through Green Mountain) participates in the "Keurig Green to Go" program.  Used K-cups are collected and shipped back to the company for recycling purposes.  Further, the Firm has recently switched from plastic to paper plates for usage in our four kitchens/break areas.  From a paper management standpoint, the Firm has implemented two-sided printing at all printers throughout its offices, and purchased a significant amount of recycled paper for use in its daily practice.   Lastly, the Firm is always looking to improve upon efficiencies in its purchasing with vendors, bulk buying whenever possible to reduce transportation emissions on deliveries and packaging of outgoing mail for pick-up at several dedicated times throughout the day.  

    <br><br> From an energy standpoint, the Firm has implemented an energy management system administered by Touzour-Trane to run and manage all heating and lighting (and scheduling of same) throughout its facilities.  This includes a timer-program for occupied vs. unoccupied status in the building for both lighting and temperature.  All common areas are on lighting timers (interior and exterior).  The Firm's Facilities Manager and staff are constantly monitoring all aspects of energy usage and conservation efforts.

    <br><br> The Firm is also cognizant of its carbon footprint and is routinely taking efforts to reduce it.  The Firm's Facilities Manager reviews the electric bill each month and on an annual basis (reviewing for a year-over-year comparison) to look for any abnormalities or spikes in usage and will then make adjustments to the energy program as necessary.  From a purchasing standpoint, the Firm secures its electricity from a third-party (Hudson) which contacts it twice yearly to review its electric and gas usage and associated rates and to review any modifications that need to be made.

    <br><br> As a law firm with a global practice, Kessler Topaz attorneys travel a great deal.  While many of its engagements require the Firm to be present in-person (e.g., court hearings, depositions, mediations, Board meetings, etc.), wherever possible, the Firm has established a seamless video conferencing link-up at both offices to provide for remote conferencing with clients and counsel.  Kessler Topaz also does a fair amount of carpooling when possible to attend events to promote greener travel, and the Firm provides bussing for all employees for Firm-sponsored events, reducing the number of cars being used.

    <br><br> Finally, Kessler Topaz has a current green lighting initiative that it hopes to complete by the end of 2020.  The Firm is in the process of converting all lighting throughout its offices to completely LEED certified.   This will include all conference rooms, interior offices and common area lighting.  The Firm is working with a local energy company and an electrician to complete this project and obtain its LEED certification.
